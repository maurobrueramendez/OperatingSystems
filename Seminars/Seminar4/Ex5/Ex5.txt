[Challenging exercise] Assume exercise 4, but now consider that threads can have 3
rankings (1, 2, and 3), the thread ranking is specified at the beginning of the thread
function. The value of the thread ranking (which is determined randomly) specifies the
number of resources that are taken from the database, meaning that if a thread has a
ranking 3, it uses the database as if there were 3 threads of ranking 1. Implement a
resource management system with a mutex and a condition variable (monitors) to
control the usage of the database. There is no need for any type of optimization pattern
of the resource usage, a first-come first-served strategy is enough.
To do so, create a request_resources function that prints the thread id, its rank and
the resources available, specifying if resources were acquired or not. Similarly, create a
relase_resources function that specifies the thread id, its rank, and the number of
resources released, as well as the number of resources available.
