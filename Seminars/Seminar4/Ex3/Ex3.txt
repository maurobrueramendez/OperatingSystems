There is an array (A[10]) in which each position has a random value from 0 to 2. The
values represent the number of particles that are in a specific moment in a specific
position (cell). Implement a threaded “particle” move operation: void * move(void
arg), which arg is a struct containing to integers i and j, so that if in cell i there are
more than 0 particles, the function moves one of the particles in i to the cell with index
j.

a. Create the number of threads required to move simultaneously a particle from
each even cell to the next greater odd cell, meaning from cell 0 one particle
moves to cell 1, from cell 2 one particle moves from cell 3, etc. Do you need any
synchronization mechanism?

b. Now assume 10 particles move, but decide randomly from which cell to which
other cell they move. Hence no specific order needs to be preserved. Do you
need any synchronization mechanism?

c. Now assume that a gust of wind blows from the cell with the lowest index, moving
particles from all cells to the next higher index cell. From the ninth cell they can’t
move. Do you need any synchronization mechanism? How would you do it?
