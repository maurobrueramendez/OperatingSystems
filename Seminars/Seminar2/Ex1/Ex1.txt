Write a C program to write into a file, writing (with write) has to be performed by the
parent process and the child process. To do so, first open the file, then create the child
process. Next, use the output from the fork function to establish the writing of the child
and the parent processes. So, write “World” in the child’s process and “Hello” in the
parent’s process, delay each write function using usleep by the 4 digits of each of
their PID, meaning if their PID is 23456, delay for 2345 microseconds.

Now, after executing the fork function, open the file. What happens, and how can
this behavior be justified? Make different tests varying the delays.
