Create a program that generates a child and communicates bidirectionally with it using 2
pipes. The parent will send to its child all the numbers read as CLI arguments through a
pipe. As an example, imagine that the usage of this program is the following “./exe2 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9”. Then, the child will read them all, but only send back to the parent
(through the other pipe) the even numbers, which the parent will read and print them on
the screen (standard output).
