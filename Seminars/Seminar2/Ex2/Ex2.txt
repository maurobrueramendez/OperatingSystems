a. Write a C program that creates 100 processes which all wait 1 second (using the
function sleep) and the father waits for them to finish at the end after their creation, you
can use the function wait at the parent’s side to wait for all the children to finish.

b. Modify the program so that the waiting of 1 second is done by processes started
with execvp which simply run the shell command “sleep 1”

c. Modify the program so that the waiting is of a 1 millisecond (use usleep), but
the father needs to wait until a child finishes, before starting the next one.
