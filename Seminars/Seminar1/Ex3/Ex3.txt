Write a program that reads a sequence of numbers (as text) from standard input
until the input stream is closed (EOF). The integers are separated by newlines. The
program must convert them to binary integers, and compute the sum of all integers
read and write, in binary the final accumulated result to a file whose path is given as
a command line argument. [Hint: you can use the command line program hexdump
to visualize the content of a file with binary data.]
