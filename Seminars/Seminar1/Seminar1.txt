I/O, files and directories

The main objective of this seminar is to use system calls in C to do low-level access to files
in the POSIX standard, using system calls and pointers. The system calls that you will use in
this seminar are the ones for files (open, close, read, write, lseek), and those related to
directories (opendir, closedir, readdir, mkdir). Remember that in this course you are not
allowed to use the printf and scanf directly, you will need to use read/write with sprint/sscanf
to generate the strings, and then read/write to the file descriptor.
